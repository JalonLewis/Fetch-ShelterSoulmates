# Fetch Frontend Take-Home Exercise

### Description
Fetch, a company that loves dogs, asked me to build a website that allows dog-lovers to browse a database of shelter dogs and find them a new home. The website requires users to sign in with their name and email address. Upon successful authentication, the user is taken to a search page where they can filter dogs by breed, paginate through the search results, and sort the results alphabetically by breed. Users can select their favorite dogs and generate a match.
